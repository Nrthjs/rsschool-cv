#### About me

Hello! At first I would like to thank you for this great opportunity, because last months I thought about web development and I'm glad to be here. In past I learned JS on courses but that time I didn't change my job and I regret until now. As final project I created a little game based on Starwars films - there you might fight as Luke Skywalker with Stormtroopers. It wasn't simple work for me with my experience of that time, but I liked the process. I learned what it is sprite and created some in my project. I learned how to move them and finally I got a little game - it had some mistakes, of course, but my teacher was interested in.


I would like to refresh my knowledges and I hope, we will meet on the next course!
